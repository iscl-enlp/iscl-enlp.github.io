This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Evaluation of NLP systems: metrics, methods, and practices_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).


Correct evaluation of machine learning systems is important for both
verifying new models/methods and for choosing a system to use for a
particular purpose. In this course, we will study a broad set of
issues with evaluation, such as what metrics to use; how to compare
alternative models correctly, confidently; how to make sure our
results and conclusions are verifiable.

This course is a typical seminar course. After introductory lectures
during the first few weeks, participants are required to read, discuss
and present selected papers from literature. We will also do hands-on
demonstrations of some of the concepts through a "shared task".

The normal course work is worth 6ECTS. It is possible to obtain 9ECTS
with additional work (typically a term paper).

## Requirements

Earlier machine learning exposure is essential for success in this
course. Completion of 'Statistical Language Processing' or similar
course work or experience is required.
